# Quille2
 
The early prototype in progess of a life simulator developped with Unity.

So far, my focus has been:



- Designing and implementing systems for characters' personalities and needs.

- Modular system of scriptable objects for checking and altering characters' various stats. 
 Goal is to be easy to use 



"Quille" is French for a bowling pin. The project has this name because my little base character is similar in shape.
